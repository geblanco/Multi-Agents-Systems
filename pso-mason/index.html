<h2>Particle Swarm Optimization</h2>

<p>Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a population-oriented stochastic
search technique similar to genetic algorithms and other evolutionary
computation algorithms.  The technique discovers solutions for
N-dimensional parameterized problems: basically it discovers the point
in N-dimensional space which maximizes some fitness function.</p>

<p>PSO works approximately as follows: a "swarm" of candidate solutions
("particles") are placed randomly throughout the space with a random
initial velocity vector.  This velocity vector affects how each particle
moves in the space, and it is changed each time step according to a
weighted sum of the following values: </p>

<ul>
  <li>The particle's previous velocity vector.</li>
  <li>A vector towards the <b>personal best</b> location the particle
    has ever visited.</li>
  <li> Either:
  <ul>
  <li>A vector towards the <b>global best</b>, the best location that any
    member of the swarm has ever visited.</li>
  <li>A vector towards the <b>"neighborhood best"</b>: all the particles
    are organized beforehand in a list.  A particle's neighborhood are
    himself and the M individuals on either side of him.  The
    neighborhood best is the best location any neighbor ever
    visited.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>This simulation applies PSO to a number of  simple two-dimensional
problems sufficient for visualization.  The model parameters are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Function</b>: the function applied in the space.
  "Better" return values are higher.  There are several available
  functions, all common to the stochastic search literature:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Booth</b>.  (x + 2*y - 7)<sup>2</sup> + 
        (2*x + y - 5)<sup>2</sup></li>
      <li><b>Rastrigin</b>.  20 + x<sup>2</sup> - 10*cos(2*Pi*x)
        + y<sup>2</sup> - 10*cos(2*Pi*y) </li>
      <li><b>Griewank</b>.  (1 + 1/4000 * (x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>) 
        - (cos(x)*cos(y / sqrt(2)))</li>
      <li><b>Rosenbrock</b>.  (1 - x)<sup>2</sup> +
        100*(y - x<sup>2</sup>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>NumParticles</b>: the number of particles in the swarm.</li>
  <li><b>isGlobalBest</b>: whether the global best particle has an
    influence over all the others or whether neighborhoods are
    used.</li>
  <li><b>NeighborhoodSize</b>: when isGlobalBest is false, the size of
    the particle's "neighborhood", including himself.</li>
  <li><b>MaxVelocity</b>: this defines the range of possible velocities
    for each particle (from -MaxVelocity to MaxVelocity).</li>
  <li><b>InertiaConstant</b>:The constant which is used to scale the
    previous velocity in the weighted sum.</li>
  <li><b>CognitiveConstant</b>:The constant which is used to scale the
    influence of the personal-best in the weighted sum.</li>
  <li><b>SocialConstant</b>:The constant which is used to scale the
    influence of the global- OR neighborhood-best in the weighted sum.</li>
  <li><b>SuccessThreshold</b>: A particle must reach this close to the
    global minimum (the solution) in order to be considered "optimal".
    The simulation terminates when all particles are within this
    threshold.</li>
</ul>

<p>As particles move through the space they are colored in a spectrum
from Blue to Red to illustrate their distance from the global minimum.
The global minimum is shown with a small white oval.</p>
